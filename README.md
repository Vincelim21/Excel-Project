# Microsoft Excel Learning Journey

Welcome to my Microsoft Excel Learning Journey repository! This project is dedicated to documenting my process of learning and mastering the powerful spreadsheet software, Microsoft Excel.

Here, I'll be sharing:

*   **Tutorials:** Step-by-step guides and notes on concepts I'm learning, from basic data entry and formulas to advanced features like pivot tables, macros, and data analysis.
*   **Projects:** Practical examples and projects where I apply my Excel skills to various tasks and datasets.
*   **Resources:** Links to helpful articles, videos, and other resources I find valuable along the way.

My goal is to create a comprehensive record of my progress, which can also serve as a resource for others beginning their Excel journey.

## Contents

*   `/tutorials`: Contains excel files covering specific Excel features and techniques.
*   `/projects`: Houses individual project folders with their respective data and Excel files (`.xlsx`).
